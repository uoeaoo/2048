2048-the-game

To run and try yourself you need to install this project and open in a VS Code or in an other program which you use for coding. 
If it's the VS code you need to compleate next steps: 

1) check out: do you have a "live server". You will need it to run an app, because if you will try to run without live server you will receive next error: 
Access to script at '.....2048/js/script.js' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, isolated-app, chrome-extension, chrome, https, chrome-untrusted.

So you need to install an extension: 

Name: Live Server
Id: ritwickdey.LiveServer
Description: Launch a development local Server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages
Version: 5.7.9
Publisher: Ritwick Dey
VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer

2) Right button click on index.html, open with Live Server. 

Enjoy :)
